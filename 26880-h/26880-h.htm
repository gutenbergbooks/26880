<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In this book on the Bronze Age in Ireland I have collected and
collated all my work on the period. Much of it I have already
published in the &ldquo;Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy&rdquo;
and elsewhere. I have long felt the need of a book on the
Bronze Age in Ireland, as hitherto none has appeared dealing
adequately with the arch&aelig;ology of that period in this country.</p>

<p>Within the last few years it has been recognized that the
Bronze-Age civilization in Europe did not consist of a series
of isolated communities, each developing its own type of objects
and decorations, but that there was a community of ideas and
forms extending from Mycen&aelig; all over the European continent.</p>

<p>I have described the various forms of Bronze-Age implements
of peace and of war found in Ireland, and have shown
how they are connected with similar types on the continent
of Europe. M. J. D&eacute;chelette, of the Roanne Museum, one of
the first authorities on the Bronze Age, agrees with me
in ascribing a Mycen&aelig;an origin to certain forms of Bronze-Age
implements.</p>

<p>How this Mycen&aelig;an influence penetrated to Ireland is a
matter on which there is some difference of opinion, and
possibly new discoveries may throw additional light on the
problem. As I have shown both in this and in former works,
the most probable route seems to be that of the Danube and
the Elbe, and thence by way of Scandinavia to Ireland. It is
to be hoped that now&mdash;with a concentrating of Irish interests
on Irish affairs a new impetus will be given to the study
of the history of our country, and that many workers may
be found in the fields of arch&aelig;ology and of all subjects
connected with our past.</p>

<p>In my &ldquo;Guide to the Celtic Antiquities of the Christian
Period&rdquo; I have given the history of Irish art in the Christian
period; in &ldquo;New Grange (Brugh na Boine) and other Incised
Tumuli in Ireland, the influence of Crete and the &AElig;gean
in the extreme west of Europe in early times,&rdquo; I have given
as much as is known of the pre-Christian period up to the
Bronze Age; and in this, my latest work, which has been
much interrupted by illness, I have endeavoured to complete
the history of ancient art in Ireland.</p>

<p>I have to thank the Councils of the Royal Irish Academy
and of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland for the loan
of a number of blocks. In other cases drawings have been made
direct from objects in the National Museum by Miss E. Barnes.</p>

<p>The plates are from photographs taken by the photographer
of the National Museum.</p>

<p>In offering this book to the public I must express my
gratitude to Mr. E. C. R. Armstrong, to whom I am indebted
for his unvarying kindness and sympathy, and for much
valuable assistance both in the matter and form of the work.</p>

<h1>THE BRONZE AGE IN IRELAND</h1>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>


<p>This book deals with the Bronze Age principally from the
point of view of the implements and weapons in use in Ireland
during that period. It is unnecessary to state that the
materials for writing anything like a full account of the
civilization or political organization during the Bronze Age do
not exist; and even the ethnological affinities of the dominant
race that inhabited Ireland during this period are doubtful.
All that can be said is that there was apparently no gap
between the end of the Neolithic Period and the transitional
Copper to Bronze Period. Stone weapons continued in use side
by side with those of copper and bronze; and the form of the
former was sometimes actually influenced by those of the
latter.</p>

<p>There has been so little scientific excavation in Ireland that
the question as to the early burial-customs is surrounded with
difficulty; such evidence as there is points to cremation having
been practised early, as was also the case in Great Britain.
Instances show that the two rites of inhumation and cremation
were practised side by side.</p>

<p>In the cairn excavated on Belmore Mountain, County
Fermanagh, both burnt and unburnt interments were found
with pottery and other objects of early Bronze-Age
type.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
At a recent excavation near Naas, County Kildare, a burnt
interment was discovered in a cist, the remains being associated
with a wrist-bracer and remains of
pottery.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
In the fine series
of cairns on Carrowkeel Mountain, County Sligo, burnt and
unburnt interments were found associated with pottery, bone
implements, and stone
beads.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
At Annaghkeen, County
Galway, a cremated burial was discovered in a cist associated
with pottery and a small bronze knife-dagger and
awl.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The Hon. John Abercromby gives a list of food-vessels found
with cremated burials in Ireland, and to these must be added a
food-vessel of early type found in 1912 in a quarry at Crumlin,
County Dublin. It must, however, be left for future excavations
to decide many questions to which at present no answer,
or only a doubtful one, can be given. This, however, is
certain&mdash;Ireland during the Bronze Age was not isolated, but
stood in direct communication with the Continent. &AElig;gean and
Scandinavian influences can be detected in the great tumuli of
the New Grange
group<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>;
and Iberian influence is discernible in
some of the later types of bronze implements. Ireland, as will
be shown in the chapters dealing directly with the gold objects,
was, during the Bronze Age, a kind of western El Dorado,
owing to her great richness in gold; Irish gold ornaments have
been found both on the Continent and in Scandinavia; while
Scandinavian amber has been found in Ireland. As will be
seen on p. <a href="#Page_81">81</a>, the Bronze-Age people were acquainted with
the art of weaving; and fine ornaments of horse-hair were
sometimes used. The art of making pottery by hand was
carried to a high degree of excellence. Shaving must have been
fairly common, judging by the number of bronze razors found.
We shall find evidence further on in this work to show that
corn was probably grown and agriculture fairly advanced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
The great tumuli at New Grange and the lesser ones at
Carrowkeel show that the art of building was well developed,
and that the religious ideals of the people had attained a certain
fixed form. What the actual dwellings occupied by the people
were we cannot say; but it is probable that many of the
promontory-forts and some at least of the larger cashels and
ring-forts date back to this period. There remain, however,
many questions which, as we have said, must be kept over for
future investigations.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>The Chronology of the Irish Bronze Age</strong></span></p>

<p>Some discussion as to the absolute chronology of the Bronze
Age in Ireland will, no doubt, be expected, though any attempts
to give actual dates can only be approximate; the succession
of types is really of considerably more importance than the
actual date, as such a succession enables objects, finds, and
interments to be arranged in a progressive series, and shows the
general trend of advance and culture. The doyen of prehistoric
arch&aelig;ology, Dr. Oscar Montelius, of Stockholm, has been the
pioneer of the study of the prehistoric chronology of Europe,
his chronology of the Bronze Age in Scandinavia having been
published as far back as 1885. Since then he has published
the results of his studies of the Bronze-Age chronologies of
Greece and Italy, and of France, Belgium, South Germany, and
Switzerland. More recently (1908) he has put forward the
chronology of the British Islands in a notable memoir published
in Arch&aelig;ologia. It may be mentioned that Dr. Montelius
visited Ireland some years ago, and speaks with the greater
authority as having personally examined the actual Irish
evidence.</p>

<p>In this memoir Dr. Montelius divides the Bronze Age of
Great Britain and Ireland into five periods, and includes in his
first period the transitional time when copper was in use
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
(Copper Period), which he places at from the middle of
the third to the beginning of the second millennium <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Now,
though the division of the Irish Bronze Age into five periods
may be accepted, we should hardly care to place the first period
as early as Dr. Montelius suggests; and without going into the
question of the time at which the period commenced, we might
take the period of its ending at from about 2000-1800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
In this period would be included the flat copper celts of early
form, copied from the stone celts of the preceding Neolithic
Period, some few small, flat knife-daggers of copper, and the
earliest of the halberds. Stone implements, no doubt, remained
largely in use; and the very finely decorated hammer-axes
probably belong to this period.</p>

<p>It is possible that gold&mdash;which, on account of its colour and
appearance on the surface of the ground, must have been one
of the metals first noticed and made use of in prehistoric
times&mdash;was used for making ornaments at this period, or
possibly, as Prof. Gowland suggests, may have been hammered
into ornaments even during the preceding Neolithic
Age.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
There is, however, no gold object in the National Collection
which we should care to place so early.</p>

<p>The second division of the Bronze Age (the first period
of the true Bronze Age) would fall between 1800 and 1500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>;
and in it would be included, as the principal types, the flat
bronze celts&mdash;including those with the edge much wider than the
blade&mdash;flanged celts, small bronze daggers, the later halberds,
jet buttons with conical perforations, and the early types of jet
necklaces, and probably the gold lunul&aelig;.</p>

<p>The third period might be placed at from 1500 to 1250 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
and the principal types falling within it are flanged celts
with stop-ridges, tanged spear-heads, and larger dagger-blades,
sometimes with bronze handles.</p>

<p>The fourth period, which was long, and during which a
considerable development takes place, might be placed at from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
1280 to 900 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> This period includes the later type of celts
with increased stop-ridge and flanges (palstaves), and some of
the earlier forms of socketed celts, long rapiers, the earlier
type of leaf-shaped swords, and the looped and leaf-shaped
spear-heads, gold torcs, and possibly some of the bronze fibul&aelig;,
and sickles without sockets; the disk-headed pins and bronze
razors may be placed either at the end of this time or the
beginning of the next period. In this period must also be
placed the building of the great tumuli of the New Grange
group.</p>

<p>The fifth division&mdash;also a long one&mdash;would go from 900 to
about 350 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, at which time iron weapons were probably
coming into general use in Ireland. In this period would fall
the socketed celts, including the latest type, which takes a
form not uncommon among iron or steel axes, the later bronze
swords with notches below the blades, bronze sword-chapes, the
socketed sickles, probably some of the more highly ornamented
bronze spears with apertures in the blades, the bronze trumpets,
the gold fibul&aelig;, and gold gorgets. It must be remembered that
the Continental Hallstatt period is not at present well represented
in Great Britain and Ireland, and though, under
Hallstatt influence, certain Continental Iron-Age types such as
bronze caldrons, trumpets, round shields, &amp;c., found their way
into Ireland, we cannot as yet definitely separate this period
from the end of the Bronze Age.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Transitional Copper Period</strong></span></p>


<p>In Ireland the metal first used was copper. Native copper
is plentiful in Ireland, and has been chiefly obtained from the
Counties of Wicklow, Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Tipperary, and
Galway. In Waterford stone implements have been found in
copper mines in ancient workings, showing copper was mined
for at an early
period.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The time during which copper was in
use was probably relatively only a short one, much shorter than
the Neolithic Period or than the true Bronze Age. The
evidence for this period is the large number of flat copper celts
which have been found in the north and south, and east and
west, of the country. The earliest copper celts resemble in
form the stone celts from which they are derived, and were
cast in open moulds on one side only, and then hammered flat
on the other. Moulds for casting celts in this way have been
found in Ireland. It is also extremely interesting to notice
that some stone celts betray the influence of metal types by
their form. It may be well here to meet an objection that has
been raised against a special use of copper in Ireland. It has
been urged that the large number of flat copper celts may have
been due to a scarcity of tin, and that as copper cannot be cast
in closed moulds, casters who could cast advanced forms of
bronze celts were obliged to return to the primitive form
necessary for casting in an open mould. Copper ores are,
however, very rarely found in a pure state, and the small
impurities of antimony, arsenic, &amp;c., combine in the smelting
with the copper, and lend a hardness and ductibility which
would enable it to be cast in closed
moulds.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The analyses of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Irish copper celts agree among themselves, and substantially
with those from other countries, the small
quantities of tin, antimony, arsenic, &amp;c.,
which are found being due to impurities
in the ore. The celts may be taken to be
of copper, and not of poor
bronze.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The earliest copper celts resemble the stone
celts from which they are derived; some
of them are small. A development takes
place throughout the series, the celts
becoming larger and the edges thinner
as they approach the bronze forms. No
trace of a stop-ridge is ever found on
copper celts.</p>

<p>The principal finds are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1.4em; text-indent: -1.4em;">
1. Three copper celts, three copper awls, and a copper knife found,
in 1874, in a bog at Knocknague, Kilbannon, County Galway. Purchased
from the finder, Michael Rafferty, by the Royal Irish
Academy. (Fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1.4em; text-indent: -1.4em;">
2. Three copper celts, a fragment of a fourth (butt-end), a copper
halberd, and a short blade of copper of somewhat similar form,
found in 1892, near Birr, King&#8217;s County, formerly in the collection
of Mr. Robert Day, of Cork. (Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1.4em; text-indent: -1.4em;">
3. Three copper celts found in 1868, when ploughing at Cullinagh,
near Beaufort, Killarney, County Kerry. (Day Collection.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 1.4em; text-indent: -1.4em;">
4. Two large and well-formed copper celts found together
in street excavations in Suffolk Street, Dublin, in
May, 1857. (Ray Collection.) (Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>, nos. 1 and 7.)</p>

5. Two copper celts found together at Clontoo, near

<p style="margin-left: 1.4em; text-indent: -1.4em;">
6. Six copper celts found together at Cappeen, County
Cork.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
The distribution, analyses, types, and finds show that the
copper celts represent a period when copper was in common
use throughout Ireland and before bronze was generally
known. The celts from the Ray Collection mentioned above
show that the fully developed celt was in use during this
period, while the &ldquo;Birr find&rdquo; with the halberd shows that
the halberd was also known and in use during the full copper
period.</p>

<p>As already stated the Birr find shows that the halberd was
in use during the full Copper Period; and, though to judge by
the form of the celts, we may place it at the end of the period, yet
more primitive types are known, and we may therefore presume
the halberd goes well back into the Copper Period.</p>

<p>The National Collection at Dublin contains forty-nine
specimens of these broad coppery blades. In a few cases there
may possibly be a doubt as to whether they should be classified
as halberds or primitive daggers. The localities of the majority
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
are not known further than that they have been found in
Ireland; but from the known localities they seem, like the
copper celts, to have been found in all parts of the island;
and local distinctions of type, if they existed, are not now
possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What may be considered as the developed or normal type of
the Irish halberd blade is slightly but distinctly curved, so that
they have been called &ldquo;scythe-shaped.&rdquo; They vary from about
9 inches to 15 or 16 inches in length, and from about 3 to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
4 inches in breadth at the widest part; with few exceptions
they have three rivets with large heads. The various sizes are
well represented in a find of seven of these blades obtained in
1888 when making the railway near Hollywood, County Galway.
They were described as having been found about 2&frac12; feet under
the surface of a shallow bog &ldquo;stuck in a bunch in the ground,
with points down. No other relics appeared near them.&rdquo; We
do not think it is any use attempting to place the halberds in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
series of development; and no progression can be claimed for
their forms other than that there appears to be a movement of
development from the smaller straight blades to the larger and
curved blades. In one or two cases the mid rib has been
brought to a slight roof-ridge; and a fine example in the late
Sir John Evans&#8217; collection shows a well-marked bead down the
mid rib (&ldquo;Bronze Implements,&rdquo; fig. 331); but in most cases
the mid rib is quite plain with a rounded curve in section.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Analyses</strong></span></p>

<p>Analyses of the halberd blades show that the metal of which
they are composed does not differ much from that of the copper
celts. A recent analysis of five specimens is appended which
shows that the blades are practically of pure copper. This is
interesting, as it removes the doubt expressed by Sir John Evans
in &ldquo;Bronze Implements,&rdquo; p. 265, that &ldquo;many of these blades
have the appearance of being made of copper; but the absence
of tin in their composition has not been proved.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 11.&mdash;Halberds from North Germany and Sweden after Montelius.</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The manner in which the halberd blades were attached to
their shafts is explained by the bronze halberds with bronze
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
shafts&mdash;the blade and upper part of the shaft often in one
piece&mdash;from North Germany and from Sweden. These halberds
are referred to an early stage of the Bronze Age; but they are
of bronze, and, in casting and other features, show a considerable
advance on a primitive type; the large imitation rivets cast in
the head of the shaft no doubt represent an earlier form in which
the shaft was of wood and the rivets real. Ten bronze halberd
blades were found together near Stendal in Prussian Saxony,
but without handles, four of which are figured by Montelius in
&ldquo;Die Chronologie der &auml;ltesten Bronzezeit,&rdquo; figs. 115-118. An
analysis of one of the blades gave 15 per cent. of tin and of a
rivet 4&middot;5 per cent. of tin. From the straight mark across the
blades, and some bronze tubular pieces for the handles, there
seems no doubt that they were intended for straight wooden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
handles, and thus represent the earlier type. The blades are
about 12&frac14; inches in length. It is important to note that the
rivets are of two kinds: some are large and stout like the usual
Irish form; and some have metal washers, like the solitary
example found in Ireland (fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>), and which has caused some
authorities to consider the Irish halberd blades somewhat later
than we should care to place them. In general appearance these
halberd blades from Stendal are closer to the Irish halberds than
any of the others which have been found on the Continent, but
do not include the curved or scythe-shaped form common to
Ireland. Copper halberds, with remains of transverse wooden
shafts, have been found by the brothers Siret on the south-east
of Spain. In this case they go back to the very beginning of
the bronze age in this district. The form of the blades is, however,
in most cases <strong>T</strong>-shaped, and different from the Irish
examples (fig. <a href="#fig12">12</a>). Halberds attached to their shafts are
also shown on the prehistoric rock-markings in the &ldquo;Italian
Maritime Alps,&rdquo; published by Mr. C. Bicknell. The actual
blades, however, that can be classified with any certainty as
halberds are very rare in the North and Middle Italian districts,
though some of the copper and early bronze triangular dagger
forms may have been occasionally mounted as halberds. It is
possible, however, that the decoration of certain halberds found
in Germany may have been influenced by that of the Italian
dagger.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
The halberd blade can be distinguished from the broad
dagger by the shape of the handle, which is curved or indented
in the case of the dagger, but straight across in the case of the
halberd. There is, however, another point. The hindmost
rivets, both in the case of the blades with four rivets and those
with three only, are shorter than those in front of them. The
shortness of the end-rivets and slope of the heads imply that
the handle was rounded off behind the blade, as would be the
case with a transverse shaft. So there appears no room to
doubt the manner in which the long scythe-shaped blades were
mounted on handles, though some uncertainty was formerly
expressed on the subject. The Irish halberd-blades were
evidently mounted at right angles to the shaft in the same
way as most of the Continental blades, as can be seen from the
straight-across marks of the handle, which can be traced on
several examples.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the analyses of copper halberds, it will be seen that
the tin varies from &middot;18 to &middot;31 per cent. We may therefore
conclude that the copper halberds are simply coarse or unrefined
copper from similar ores to the copper celts; and that the
copper implements found in Ireland may contain up to about
&middot;5 per cent. of tin. An increasing percentage of tin was not
found in any of the copper celts, or, contrary to expectation,
in the copper halberds; but, judging from the widespread
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
use of copper implements in Ireland, from which it may
be inferred that copper remained in use for a considerable
time, it seems probable that bronze was introduced as an alloy
of a known percentage of tin. As relatively few analyses of
Irish bronze implements have been made, it is not possible at
present to come to any fixed conclusions on the subject of the
introduction of bronze into Ireland.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, in the case of the halberds, the great rarity of any
specimens of bronze blades which can be classified as halberds
indicates that the form of implement practically ceased to be
used when bronze came into use in Ireland. As the copper
celts show a gradual transition from stone to metal forms, it
seems reasonable to look for the prototypes of the copper
halberd among the stone implements of the preceding period.
In the Bann Valley many flint wedges or picks have been
found, which may, perhaps, have influenced the copper
halberds; and if a stone pick-like instrument was in use in
Neolithic times, it may explain to some extent the prevalence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of the metal halberd in Ireland in the copper period. When
the blades were made larger, the curved form would come into
existence, being suggested by the deer-horn picks already in use.
Copper came into use in Ireland, we may suppose, in no sudden
or violent manner. On the contrary, the transition from stone
was probably of some duration. The use of copper made its way
up through Europe, spreading from the lands of the eastern
Mediterranean along the old trade routes of Neolithic times,
influenced by the search for new deposits of ore. Though at
first implements of copper, and even, perhaps, the metal, might
be carried a considerable distance, an early use of the local ores
seems to explain the case better.</p>

<p>Whether this new knowledge of metal, coming from the
eastern Mediterranean, first crept round by way of Spain, or
struck across the Continent to the north and west of Europe,
and so to Ireland, we cannot at present definitely say; the line of
march, as indicated by the halberds, which are strangely deficient
both in the south and the north of France, seems to point to north
Germany and Scandinavia, by way of the rich ore-fields of
middle Europe. But the arch&aelig;ology of the Peninsula for this
early period is at present too uncertain to speak with confidence.
There are indications, even in Neolithic times, which, perhaps,
point to Spain; but, again, there are relations which indicate a
considerable correspondence with Brittany and the North of
France in the early Bronze Age. The late Dr. Much (&ldquo;Die
Kupferzeit,&rdquo; p. 131) compared the Irish halberds with the
Spanish and German examples, and came to the conclusion that
the Irish halberds were later than the Spanish and earlier than
the German. This view is supported by the form of the Irish
halberds, which are more primitive in type than the German
examples.</p>

<p>Any conclusion as to the probable date when the halberds
were in use in Ireland can only be arrived at in an indirect and
approximate manner. We are, on the whole, inclined to think
it is probable that the Irish halberds were influenced by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Spanish examples; and Herr Hubert Schmidt, who has worked
out in much detail a scheme of chronology for this period,
based upon the Egyptian dating of Professor Eduard Meyer,
places the finds from El Argar at from 2500 to 2360
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Allowing, therefore, some margin on the later side, we should
probably be fairly safe in placing the period when the halberds
were in use in Ireland at the end of the third and beginning of
the second millennium <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> We must remember that the whole
of the Irish Bronze Age has to be fitted in after the copper
period; and if we are to allow sufficient room for the several
periods and their approximate correspondence with the periods of
the Continental chronology, it is not easy to see how this dating
can be much reduced. It may be noted that Montelius in his
recent scheme of Bronze Age chronology for the British Islands,
treats the halberds as bronze, and places them in his second period
(first period of the true Bronze Age) dated from the beginning
of the second millennium to the seventeenth century

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>First and Later Periods of the Bronze Age</strong></span></p>


<p>Even during the copper period an evolution can be traced in
the celt. The cutting-edge has been expanded; and the thickest
part of the celt has been moved up from just above the cutting-edge
to the centre. Until, however, we get into the Bronze Age,
there has been no trace of a stop-ridge. When we get into the
true Bronze Age, we find a complete and probably fairly rapid
evolution of type from the flat celt to the final socketed form.
Analyses of Irish celts on a large scale have not been made;
but such analyses as have been done do not indicate an experimental
stage of small additions of tin, but rather show that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
bronze from the first contained a fairly large proportion of
tin. Where the tin came from is at present uncertain. The
illustrations will make the evolution of the celt clear. The
first step was the broadening of the cutting-edge, and moving
the thickest part up to the centre of the blade; the next step
was hammering the sides to make flanges to grip the handle
more securely; a stop-ridge was then added to prevent the
handle slipping down over the blade; and the latter forms are
reached by increasing the flanges and broadening the stop-ridge;
in its last forms the wings are increased at the expense of the
stop-ridge; and the final socketed form is reached by leaving
out the centre division between the wings. Figure <a href="#fig19">20</a> may be
noticed, as it is very similar to certain Continental forms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the earlier flat bronze celts may have been hafted
like the stone celts, by merely fixing the smaller end into a
stick with a thick head; but this method must soon have
been abandoned, as after a certain number of blows had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
delivered, the axe-head would be forced back into the shaft. A
more practical method was to place the head in a handle having
a forked head, and the origin of the stop-ridge was to prevent
the two sides coming down too low on to the blade. The side
flanges and palstave-form developed naturally from this.
The manner of hafting the socketed celts is well shown by
a handled socketed celt found at Edenderry, King&#8217;s Co., and
formerly in the Murray collection. This object is now in the
Ethnological and Arch&aelig;ological Museum at Cambridge; and
it is to be regretted that so rare and important a find should
have left the country.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 17.&mdash;Ornamented Bronze Celts.</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the flat bronze celts are very finely decorated
with incised chevrons, triangles, cross-hatchings, and other
Bronze-Age linear ornament. One example has a kind of
herring-bone pattern, somewhat resembling the well-known leaf-marking
at New Grange. Some examples show a kind of cable-pattern
on the side flanges; and the size of a few specimens is
remarkable. A flat celt, with a remarkable ornamentation from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the Greenwell collection found near Connor, County Antrim, is
figured by Sir John Evans, <em>op. cit.</em>, p. 64. It has a border of
chevrons along the edge of the side; and this is carried across
the celt in the centre and at the commencement of the cutting-edge.
This border is joined by a similar centre band of ornament.</p>

<p>Several of the Irish palstaves have a shield-shaped ornament
below the stop-ridge. The socketed celts are, as a rule, unornamented;
but there are a few which have been found in Ireland
which are ornamented with ribs ending in pellets.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 18.&mdash;Ornamented Bronze Celts.</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The question is often asked as to whether the bronze celts
were used as weapons or tools; and the probability is that they
were used as either as occasion demanded. The celts do not
show any marked difference of type which would enable us to
differentiate a weapon from a tool, as is possible in the later
iron axes of the Norman and Danish period when we can distinguish
a heavy axe and a lighter keen blade. The Bayeux
tapestry shows the two types in use, the heavy type being used
to fell trees and the lighter for fighting.</p>

<p>There is one palstave, with double loops, in the National
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Collection; and another was found in Ireland at Ballincollig,
County Cork, and is in the Evans collection. These double-looped
palstaves are of much interest, as the type is characteristic
of the Iberian peninsula. A few have been found in the
west of France, and some in the south-west of England, but
on the route which one would expect to have been followed
if they are due to intercourse with Spain. These probably
belong to the Middle Bronze Age, though they have not as
yet been found associated with objects which would give much
information as to their date.</p>

<p>Among objects that may undoubtedly be classed as tools
are the small bronze anvil (fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>), and the bronze socketed
hammers (fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
The anvil appears to be the only specimen which has been
found in the British Islands, though examples are not uncommon
in France. It resembles the small anvils used by
jewellers, and it is interesting to note that, as M. D&eacute;chelette
points out, these small bronze
anvils correspond to those mentioned
by Homer, which were also portable and used by
goldsmiths.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Socketed bronze hammers resembling
the Irish examples are
fairly common in England and on
the Continent. One well-known Irish specimen was found in
the Douris hoard and is figured in Evans&#8217;s &ldquo;Bronze Implements,&rdquo;
p. 179. Of the specimens illustrated, the largest was found at
Abbeyshrule, Co. Longford, the exact locality of the others,
further than that they were found in Ireland, is not known.</p>

<span class="smcap"><strong>Spear-Heads</strong></span></p>

<p>Even as early as the Copper Period small weak knife-daggers
were in use, and these continued into the Bronze Age, becoming
the parent of the spear-head as well as of the rapier and sword.
The spear-head was evolved by decreasing the width of the
base of the dagger-blade, and adding a narrow tang with a peg-hole
to fix into the shaft. The addition of a ferule was the next step;
and the omission of the tang, and amalgamation of the ferule
with the blade, gave rise to the socketed spear-head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
The Irish spear-heads may be divided into two well-defined
groups, looped and riveted; and it will be found that
the separation of the types extends farther than the mode
of attachment. The form of the blade of each class is
quite distinct. Taking the looped spear-heads first, we can
follow the development of the spear-head from the dagger-blade.
The adaptation is shown in fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a> (the centre spear-head),
which is, in fact, a dagger-blade placed on a socket.
The socket does not enter the blade, but is stopped at the
shoulders. The <strong>V</strong>-shaped base of the blade is derived from the
dagger, and disappears as the true character of the spear form is
developed. A feature of special interest is the survival of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
rivet-heads of the dagger in the form of ornamental bosses at the
base of the blade. The rivet-holes appear to have been drilled,
and not formed in casting. No examples of this form of spear-head
have been found in England; and but one is recorded from
the Isle of Man and two from Scotland. In the last example
(in fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a>), the imitative rivets are reduced to a single boss,
and completely disappear in the next stage (fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the subsequent figures we see the blade developed at
the expense of the socket; and the transition to the fully
developed spear-head begins. The derivation of this form of
spear-head from the so-called Arreton Down type of tanged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
blade is now admitted. Though tanged spear-heads of the
Arreton Down type are fairly represented in Irish finds, no
socket has been so far recovered with any of them;
but an early form of nondescript tanged blade
with a socket was found at Lough Ruadh bog
near Tullamore, King&#8217;s County, in 1910, and
shows the socket was known in Ireland.</p>

<p>Another very early type of spear-head, nearly
all the known examples of which were found in
Ireland, was derived by mounting the rapier on
a socket (fig. <a href="#fig26">27</a>). There are six of these spear-heads
in the collection of the Royal Irish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Academy, and one in the collection of the Royal Society of
Antiquaries of Ireland. One of these spear-heads, found at
Taplow on the Thames, has gold studs at the base of the blade
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
which, no doubt, represent the rivets. The derivation of the
spear-head by gradually rounding off the corners of the blade
can be easily followed.</p>

<p>We will now turn to the spear-heads with rivet-holes in the
sockets, but without loops or openings in the blades (figs. <a href="#fig28">28</a> and <a href="#fig30">30</a>).
These spear-heads are almost invariably leaf-shaped
and devoid of ribs. The pins or rivets used to attach this class
to the shaft were probably of wood, horn, or bone. Two
examples formerly in Mr. Day&#8217;s collection have rivets of bronze,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and others with bronze rivets have been found in England. The
leaf-shaped spear-head is associated by form with the leaf-shaped
sword; the looped type with the older type of weapons,
the dagger and rapier forms. The records of the finds are very
incomplete; but the association of leaf-shaped spears and
swords to the exclusion of the looped form is sufficiently marked
to be noted as an additional piece of evidence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are in the Academy&#8217;s collection a number of spear-heads
with rivet-holes in the sockets and ornamental side-apertures
(figs. <a href="#fig33">33</a> and <a href="#fig33">34</a>). These spear-heads are very highly decorated,
and form an attractive class. They may be derived from the
spear-heads in which the loops are joined to the base of the
blade (fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>), and in which, by a process of evolution, the loop
has been incorporated as part of the wing, or they may also have
been influenced by the early type of tanged spear-heads from
the Greek islands, in which the openings in the blade were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
functional, being used for binding the head into a split shaft.
These ornamental spear-heads belong, as a type, to the British
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Islands, where the socketed spear-head itself appears to have
been evolved. Several of these spear-heads have, as well as
the wings, small holes in the blades, the purpose of which
is not clear. They are very finely cast; and even in Ireland,
where Bronze-Age casting reached its highest point, these are
amongst its best products.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another very rare type of spear-head, in which the loops
are formed by the extension of the small ribs on each side of
the mid rib, must be mentioned. These spear-heads are very
seldom met with. We only know of the existence of four,
of which one is in the Greenwell collection, two in the
collection of the Royal Irish Academy, and one in the
Municipal Museum at Belfast. The Academy was fortunate
enough to secure a very fine specimen in 1912. It was
found with two leaf-shaped bronze swords at Tempo, County
Fermanagh,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and measures 15&frac12; inches long (fig. <a href="#fig36">37</a>).
Judging from the associated swords, this spear-head may be
dated about the ninth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>The most important moulds for casting spear-heads found in
Ireland are a series for casting early tanged spear-heads which
were found about thirty years ago at Omagh, County Tyrone,
and are now in the possession of Mr. M. J. Sullivan. These
moulds are of the greatest importance in the history of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
development of the bronze spear-head, as they show the evolution
of the tanged blade to the socketed form, and also that
the tanged and socketed forms were in contemporary use in
Ireland. The form of the moulds for the socketed spear-heads
shows them to be at the very commencement of this type; and
it was probable that the tanged type was rapidly superseded by
the improved socketed form.</p>

<p>Another very important find of moulds was made in
1910 at Killymeddy, near Ballymoney, County Antrim. This
find included two complete moulds and a half mould for casting
looped socketed spear-heads. Of the other moulds for casting
spear-heads found in Ireland, nearly all are for the looped type;
and the few that have been found for casting the leaf-shaped
type are small and indeterminate in character. It is most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
probable that, with the introduction of the leaf-shaped spear-heads,
moulds of clay or sand were introduced; and these have
naturally perished. Fragments of a clay mould for casting
a spear-head and a sword were found at Whitepark Bay, and
portions of clay moulds for spear-heads have been found in
Brittany, the Lake of Bienne, and other places. The discoveries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of moulds enforce the distinction of type between the looped
and leaf-shaped spear-heads, and the moulds from Killymeddy
(figs. <a href="#fig38">38-40</a> and <a href="#fig43">43</a>) may probably be placed at the end of the
period when stone moulds were in use, and assigned to about
1500-1200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>From time to time objects of bronze have been found in
Ireland of a curious shape, somewhat like the handle of a door;
and their use was considered uncertain; it is, however, clear that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
they were the ferules of spears; and in some cases the remains
of the wooden shafts have been found inside them. The finding,
moreover, of one in the Lisnacroghera Crannog with the whole
of the shaft, measuring 8 feet in length, attached to it, places
the matter beyond
dispute.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
It also shows that these objects
were in use down to the early Iron Age, as most of
the objects of the Lisnacroghera find belong to the La T&egrave;ne
period.</p>

<p>Other ferules assume a long and graceful shape, and one is
decorated with La T&egrave;ne motives (fig. <a href="#fig44">45</a>).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Irish Gold</strong></span></p>


<p>Ireland&#8217;s extreme richness in gold during the Bronze Age
made her a kind of El Dorado of the western world. The
gold was, no doubt, obtained from County Wicklow, where gold
was worked down to the end of the eighteenth century, nuggets
of 22, 18, 9, and 7 oz. being recorded. One exceptionally
large nugget weighing 22 oz., found in 1795 at Croghan
Kinshela, Co. Wicklow, was presented to King George III;
and its discovery caused a rush to the workings. As well
as Wicklow there are six other counties where gold has been
found. The very large number of gold ornaments that have
been found in Ireland is therefore not surprising. The ancient
literature of Ireland contains many references to gold ornaments
and payments of gold by weight. It is interesting to note
that the tradition preserved in the Book of Leinster, a <span class="smcap">ms.</span>
of the twelfth century, refers the first smelting of gold in
Ireland to a district in which gold has been found in considerable
quantities in modern times. The Leinstermen, it is stated,
were called &ldquo;Lagenians of the gold,&rdquo; because it was in their
country that gold was first discovered in Erin. It is further
stated that gold was first smelted for Tighearnmas, one of the
earliest of the Milesian kings, in the forests standing on the
east side of the River Liffey, by Iuchadan, a native of that
district.</p>

<p>After the discovery of native gold in Ballinvally stream at
Croghan in 1796, the Government undertook mining operations;
and in three years collected 944 ounces worth, at the price of
the day, &pound;3,675. Since the workings were abandoned by the
Government, the district has been worked at intervals by
companies, and at other times by the peasants; the total output
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
since 1795 is estimated at a value of &pound;30,000. The knowledge
of the Irish gold deposits must have been a very considerable
factor in the foreign relations of the island in the Bronze
Age.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Lunul&aelig;</strong></span></p>

<p>The earliest of the Irish gold ornaments are the flat gold
collars known as lunul&aelig;. These have been found fairly evenly
distributed over the country, and in astonishing numbers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fig46" id="fig46"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 46.&mdash;Gold Lunula found at Trenta, Carrigans, Co. Donegal.</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The circumstances under which the lunul&aelig; have been
found have not often been recorded. The collection of the Royal
Irish Academy in the National Museum, Dublin, contains no less
than thirty-seven examples. Several of these have been found
and recorded during the past three or four years. As a rule
the lunul&aelig; are engraved on one face only with finely cut or
scored well-recognized Bronze Age ornament, consisting of bands
of lines, cross-hatchings, chevrons, triangles, and lozenges.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
The centres of the lunul&aelig; are plain, the exact reason of
which is not quite apparent. The ornament is gathered to the
end of the lunula and spaced out by bands. Two lunul&aelig; found
together at Padstow, Cornwall, are said to have been found with
a bronze celt of early type. The find is preserved in the Truro
Museum, and is of the utmost importance as an indication of
the early Bronze-Age date of the lunul&aelig;. It is, we believe, the
only instance of lunul&aelig; being found with associated objects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Figures <a href="#fig46">46-49</a> and <a href="#fig51">51-53</a> illustrate the various types of
ornament; it will be noticed that some of the smaller examples
are quite plain.</p>

<p>One lunula was found in an oak case at Newtown, Crossdoney,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Co. Cavan. The case has greatly shrunk since it was found, as
when first discovered it measured 10 inches by 8 inches (fig. <a href="#fig50">50</a>).</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 48.&mdash;Gold Lunula, locality not recorded.</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two expanded pieces at the ends are always turned at
right angles to the plane of the lunula, and serve to clasp the
back of the neck, and may have been secured by a tie. It need
not, however, be pointed out that they are quite out of place
in a head-ornament; indeed, the geometrical shape of a lunula is
contrary to such a theory, and quite different from recognized
diadems or head-ornaments.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
One example found at Volognes has a chain and sort of
buckle attached at the ends. It has since been melted down,
but a drawing of it has been preserved (fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>). The chain
seems to have been ancient&mdash;at least it is stated to have been
on it, as shown, when found; but, however ancient it may
be, it is evident that it was more recently attached than
the original make of the ornament. It is, however, of interest
as indicating at some time a chain-tie to secure the ends of
the ornament.</p>

<p>The accompanying list of finds shows how numerous the
lunul&aelig; are in Ireland and how rarely they have been found
outside this island. The map shows their distribution (fig. <a href="#fig54">54</a>).</p>

Two have been found in the West Baltic at Zealand and
Funen. They have otherwise hardly penetrated beyond
Brittany. One has recently (1912) been found at Hanover,
and another some time ago at Fauvillers, Luxembourg. This
failure to penetrate far beyond the coasts of England and
Brittany may point to early raids; but the copper and tin of
Cornwall, as well as the tin deposits of Brittany and the
general trade with Brittany, may indicate the early seeking of
the Irish gold deposits. We may take as a provisional date for
the lunul&aelig;, 1200 to 1000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 55.&mdash;Stone celt, Bronze dagger with gold band, and Urn found
in Topped Mountain Cairn, Co. Fermanagh.</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As has been mentioned, as well as being parent to the spear-head,
the small weak knife-dagger frequently found in early
Bronze-Age burials also developed into the true dagger-blade,
and in course of time into the sword. Bronze daggers have
often been found in Ireland; there are about forty in the
National Collection. Among the most interesting finds of
these early daggers may be mentioned that discovered in
1897 at an interment at Topped Mountain Cairn, County
Fermanagh. This dagger measures 5&#8541; inches, and is covered
with a beautiful blue patina. It is decorated with raised lines
on each side of the blade, and has two small rivets. It was
discovered in a cist in the cairn lying at the right side of the
skull of an uncremated body, and in the same place was a small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
band of gold which appears to have been half of a band of that
metal which was probably round the handle of the dagger
(fig. <a href="#fig55">55</a>). Another interesting find is the small bronze dagger
discovered with urns and cremated bones in a cist at Annaghkeen
Cairn, County Galway, in 1908.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 56.&mdash;Dagger and Rapier blades.</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In course of time the length of the dagger-blade was
increased; and later examples are wonderful specimens of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
casting. The earlier daggers were either attached to the handle
by rivets, or else notches were left in the base of the blade for
the attachment. The manner of hafting them is quite clear, as
a few hafted examples have been found. Some had bronze
handles cast separately (fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a>); others had handles of horn or
wood (fig. <a href="#fig57">57</a>); but the hilts for the most part were made of
some perishable substance, and they have consequently not been
recovered. The scolloped mark left by the hilt is often quite
plainly to be seen on the blade. In later times the handle was
sometimes cast in one piece with the blade; but the division
between the handle and the blade is always quite clearly
marked. The decoration of the later dagger-blades takes the
form of a number of triangles at the base of the blade, and the
extreme similarity in decoration between the Italian and the
early northern and western daggers has led Montelius to
consider the latter as derived from the former; and this is
enforced in the case of the Irish examples by the series of small
hatched-triangles which have been found at the base of two
well-known Irish examples (fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a>).</p>

<p>The rapiers were evolved quite naturally by lengthening the
dagger-blade; and this form was probably influenced also, as
will be mentioned later, by contemporary weapons in use in the
Mediterranean lands.</p>

<p>The longest rapier ever found in Western Europe is the
splendid weapon found at Lissane, Co. Derry, in 1867, which
measures 30&frac14; inches in length (fig. <a href="#fig57">59</a>). Another very remarkable
Irish example is the short rapier found in Upper
Lough Erne, and obtained by Mr. Thomas Plunkett, <span class="smcap">m.r.i.a.</span>,
from the finder. This weapon is a wonderfully fine piece of
casting. It measures 16&frac34; inches in length (fig. <a href="#fig57">58</a>).</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 60.&mdash;Rapiers and Daggers found in Ireland.</span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rapiers belong to the middle and later portions of the
Bronze Age. This type of weapon is common in France, and
is described by M. D&eacute;chelette as widely spread in the British
Islands and the north of France, and as having been introduced
from there into South Germany and the region of the Middle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Rhine.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The rapiers of advanced type he places in the third
division of the Bronze Age, as they have been found in Bronze-Age
tumuli of that period, as at Staadorf, Haut Palatinat
(1600-1300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>). Montelius places the rapiers in his fourth
period dated at the end of the fifteenth to the middle of the twelfth century
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
so that his dating of these objects
practically coincides with that of M. D&eacute;chelette. It is now well
recognized that the swords of the &AElig;gean-Mycen&aelig;an area were
developed on parallel lines to those of Western Europe. We find
that the long rapiers or thrusting swords are developed from
the tanged Cypriote dagger, and that the true sword is a later
evolution from the rapier. It is hardly to be doubted that some
of the western forms of daggers and rapiers were influenced
by Mycen&aelig;an types; and the discovery in Sicily of rapiers
of Mycen&aelig;an type with pottery dated as recent Minoan III,
establishes a direct bond between the &AElig;gean and Western
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the most striking of the gold ornaments in the
National Collection are the five gold gorgets or neck-collars,
with the ends decorated with ornamented disks. These are
very elaborately decorated, and of great massiveness. Two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
others mentioned as having been found in Ireland, one of which
was formerly in the possession of the Earl of Charleville, were
figured in &ldquo;Vetusta Monumenta.&rdquo; Vallancey states that another
was found in the County Longford. A few disks have also been
found which may have been portions of these gorgets. The
neck-portion of the gorgets is arranged in three rows of
raised ridges, and these are ornamented with rows of small
bosses, the depressions of the ridges being occupied with
a narrow rope-shaped fillet. In some cases the ridges are left
plain. The small disks at the terminals of the collar are
remarkable; they measure about 2&#8542; or 3 inches in diameter,
and are decorated with a centre and side bosses, surrounded
with concentric circles. They much resemble in miniature the
round shields or bucklers of the late Bronze Age, but they also
show some resemblance to the so-called sun-disks which have
been found in Ireland, and which will be described later on.
Unfortunately the gorgets have in no case been found with any
accompanying objects which would assist in dating them, and
in fact in only two cases have details as to their finding been
preserved, one found at Ardcroney, near Nenagh, County
Tipperary, the other at Tony Hill, Croom, County Limerick.
Their ornamentation, however, would seem to place them in
the Hallstatt period, first Iron Age, which may be dated at
about 700-600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Their form and ornamentation may be compared
with that of the splendid gold collar from Cintra, Lisbon, now in the British
Museum,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and also with the triple bronze
collars common in Scandinavia and north Germany, all of
which are referred to the Hallstatt period. This period is at
present not well represented in Ireland or the British Isles;
and it is doubtful whether iron came into general use in Ireland
till about the third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>One point of much interest must be noticed. In one of the
gorgets shown in <a href="#plate2">Plate II</a>, where the disk is attached to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
gorget, above the line where the end of the plate passes into the
boss, three perpendicular and two cross-stitches can be seen.
Some of these sewings are made by means of slight square wire,
but in others the fastenings are composed of fine woollen thread,
round which is twisted spirally a thin, flat strip of gold. These
strips are one of the oldest specimens of woollen cordage now in
existence in Ireland.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Gold Sun-disks</strong></span></p>

<p>We have already referred to the flat disks of gold, a number
of which have been found in Ireland. There are four in the
British Museum, and no less than fifteen in the National
Collection at Dublin. In four cases they have been found in
pairs&mdash;one pair at Ballina, County Mayo, another pair at
Tydavnet, County Monaghan, a third at Cloyne, Co. Cork, and
the fourth at Castle Martyr, Co. Cork. Some of these disks are
ornamented with concentric circles; others have a cruciform
ornament which resembles the four-spoked chariot-wheel, and
is a well-known sun symbol. When these objects were first
discovered, their origin and use were quite unknown; and
Mr. Reginald A. Smith, of the British Museum, was the first
to point out their resemblance to the gold disk, decorated with
spirals, affixed to a bronze sun-chariot, found in Trundholm
Moss, Zealand, in 1902. The bronze chariot consisted of a
bronze disk mounted on wheels and drawn by a horse, the gold
disk being affixed to the bronze one. The ornamentation of
the Irish disks is somewhat different, as the spiral does not
appear, its place being taken by the concentric circle. The
Trundholm sun-chariot is dated by Prof. Sophus Muller at
before 1000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The Trundholm disk is admittedly connected
with sun-worship, as is also the cruciform ornament on the
Irish disks. The spoked-wheel is a well-known solar symbol;
and similar designs have been found on the bases of some
Irish food-vessels, and may also be compared with some of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
markings at
Dowth.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The prevalence of sun-worship in the
Bronze Age need not be further gone into here; but the gold
disks are of great interest, as furnishing another point of
contact between Ireland and Scandinavia in the Bronze Age.
The finding of Irish gold lunul&aelig; in Denmark, and the
occurrence of Scandinavian amber in Irish finds of the Bronze-Age,
have already been mentioned.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Gold Balls</strong></span></p>

<p>We may also mention the large hollow golden balls of which
seven are in the National collection, one in the possession of
Mr. H. J. B. Clements, and another in the British Museum.
Eleven of these golden balls were found in 1834 at
Carrick-on-Shannon.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
There has been much conjecture as to the use these
balls were put to, and it has been suggested that as their large
size would render them inconvenient as personal ornaments,
they were probably used to decorate a horse. If so they may
have been attached to the bridle like the large balls shown on
the horses&#8217; bridles in the bronze scabbard from Hallstatt, dated
La T&egrave;ne I. See D&eacute;chelette, &ldquo;Manuel d&#8217;Arch&eacute;ologie,&rdquo; vol. ii,
p. 770. The Golden Peytrell found at Mold, Flintshire, may be
instanced to show that gold was sometimes used to decorate
horses; and if the gold balls were really used for this purpose,
we may well endorse what the author of the &ldquo;British Museum
Bronze-Age Guide&rdquo; says when he writes: &ldquo;A discovery of this
kind demonstrates in a striking manner the abundance of gold
at the end of our Bronze
period.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Clare Find</strong></span></p>

<p>Another type of neck-ornaments are the thin gold gorgets
with funnel-shaped ends, many of which were found in the
great Clare find. These gorgets are quite plain, except for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
little ornamentation at the extreme ends near the funnel-shaped
extremities. There are five of these objects in the
National Collection, and all were found together in the celebrated
Clare find. This find&mdash;the largest collective one of gold objects
ever made in Western Europe&mdash;was discovered in making a
railway-cutting for the Limerick and Ennis Railway in 1854.
A gang of labourers were digging near an old hawthorn-bush,
a little distance to the south of the railway bridge in Moghaun
north, on the west side of the line of the great fort, and opposite
the lough, when they undermined a kind of cist. The fall of
one of the containing-stones disclosed a mass of gold ornaments&mdash;gorgets,
bracelets of all sizes with cup-shaped ends,
and a few ingots of gold. The find, from a numerical point of
view, far surpassed anything ever made, but none of the objects
were highly ornamented or of a special type.</p>

<p>The fact of this immense number of gold ornaments being
hidden in a cist in this way has given rise to many conjectures;
but in the absence of any other explanation, it may be suggested
that the objects had been collected together, and hidden
purposely, with the idea of returning and regaining possession
of them later. The value of the find has been estimated at at
least &pound;3,000. Unfortunately, most of the objects were sold to
jewellers and melted down, but a large number were exhibited
at the Arch&aelig;ological Institute by Dr. Todd and Lord Talbot
de Malahide in 1854, and casts of these were taken, and a set is
now in the National Collection. There are also a small number of
the originals in the Royal Irish Academy&#8217;s collection (<a href="#plate4">Plate IV</a>).
Otherwise such objects of the find as escaped the melting-pot
were scattered, and have found their way into different museums
and private collections. As has been mentioned, the objects of
this find did not show any remarkable types, and for the most
part consisted of very thin bracelets and penannular rings
with cup-shaped ends. It is probable that, as well as being
ornaments, they served as a kind of currency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The large number of penannular rings with cup-shaped ends
which have been found from time to time in the island, brings
us on to the general question of the so-called Irish fibul&aelig;.
In Ireland penannular rings with cup-shaped ends of copper or
bronze are very rare, only about half a dozen being known,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
while fibul&aelig; of gold are exceedingly common. The Coachford
find, in which amber beads, gold fibul&aelig;, and a copper or bronze
fibula were all found together, shows that the objects were
contemporary; and as this find may be placed at the end of the
Bronze Age, it shows that these objects were in use at that period
(fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a>). On the other hand, it is likely that their use began
earlier and continued for a long period. These objects when
made of gold are of two shapes&mdash;in the one case the expanded
cups are large and flat and the connecting bar is bow-shaped,
and is striated. These have been conjectured to have been used
as brooches for fastening a garment; and their form was
probably influenced by the Scandinavian spectacle-brooches,
the bows of the latter having, in some cases, the same decoration.
Except for the striations on the connecting link, the Irish
so-called mamillary fibul&aelig; are almost always plain; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Vallancey has figured two examples, one of which is engraved
with triangular, and the other with lozenge, ornaments. There
is also the well-known example in Trinity College, Dublin, in
which the surfaces of the cups are completely covered with
concentric circle ornament, the inside rims of the cups being
decorated with hatched triangles, and the neckings of what may
be called the handle, with chevron and herring-bone pattern,
while along the back of the handle is an ornament of lozenges.
In the second type these objects assume the shape of a bracelet;
and the expanded ends are sometimes cup-shaped and sometimes
plain. From the extreme similarity between the shape
of these, whether in gold or bronze, to the so-called African
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
manillas, it has been conjectured the Irish examples, like the
African, may have been used as a medium of exchange; and on
the whole it seems probable that such was the case, the dividing
line between what were used for ornaments and what may have
been used for exchange not being at all easily defined (figs. <a href="#fig63">63</a>
and <a href="#fig64">64</a>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Ring-Money</strong></span></p>

<p>The question of a medium of exchange leads us to mention
the very small gold penannular rings, the largest being about
an inch in diameter, frequently found in Ireland, which are
known as &lsquo;ring-money.&rsquo; There are fifty-six in the National
Collection; and a find made near Belfast of a socketed bronze
celt in association with some of these objects shows they were
in use during the late Bronze
Age.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Attention has been called
to the similarity of these Irish gold rings to the penannular
copper rings plated with gold often found in early Japanese
burials.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to equate the weights of
a series of these rings with some known standard; and in his
valuable work &ldquo;The Origin of Currency and Weight Standards,&rdquo;
Professor Ridgeway devotes several pages of his Appendix C
to a discussion of the subject, and gives a table of the weights
arrived at by grouping the rings in multiples of 18.</p>

<p>While there can be no reasonable doubt that these objects
were used as a medium of exchange, we are not inclined, in the
absence of literary evidence, to go any further into the question
of what standard they may represent. Some of these rings are
evidently forgeries of ancient times, as they are composed of
bronze rings covered with a thin plate of gold. The rings as
a rule are plain; but some are ornamented with small strips of
darker metal let into the gold, and two examples are twisted
like small torcs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Leaf-shaped Swords</strong></span></p>


<p>A number of leaf-shaped bronze swords have been found in
Ireland. They may be roughly divided into two types, those
with notches just below the blade and above the handle, and those
that are plain. The latter are the earlier, and belong to the late
Bronze Age; the former correspond to the Continental swords
of the Hallstatt period. The leaf-shaped type was the typical
Bronze-Age sword of western and northern Europe. It was
developed from the dagger, and, like it, was a thrusting
rather than a cutting weapon. The handle is cast in one piece
with the blade, and has rivet-holes, and in some cases a slit for
the attachment of the hilt, which was no doubt formed of bone or
horn plates. The pommel was probably globular, and formed of
lead or some heavy material. A bronze sword of this type was
found in a house on the Akropolis at Mycen&aelig; by Schliemann, and
it can be dated at about 1200
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The discovery of this sword
may be explained either as the result of a raid, or as showing
that invaders from the north had reached Greece as early as
this date. A leaf-shaped sword has been noticed on one of the
clay tablets dated as late Minoan II, and in one of the stone slabs
from over the fifth shaft grave at Mycen&aelig;, which represents a
figure in a chariot attacking a man on foot, the latter is armed
with a leaf-shaped
sword.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
In any case it gives us a date for
the period when these swords were in common use in western
Europe. The type with notches below the blade has a
tendency to become straighter at the sides, and to lose its
leaf-shaped form. The use of the notches is not apparent, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
it has been thought that the scabbards at
that time were made of wood and were
liable to shrink from exposure to weather,
and that this may have prevented the
sword from being thrust home, so that
the edge was cut off by the notches slightly
below the handle to avoid cutting the
hand. The handle end of this latter type
very frequently assumes a form like a
fish&#8217;s tail. These swords develop into the
iron swords of the Hallstatt period, of
which so far only one Irish example
has been found. A bronze sword of the
notched type formed part of the Dowris
hoard, and is figured in the &ldquo;British
Museum Bronze-Age Guide,&rdquo; plate ii.
Two remarkably fine specimens of this
type were found in 1912 with a socketed
spear-head at Tempo, County Fermanagh.</p>

<p><a name="fig65" id="fig65"></a></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 106px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 65.&mdash;Leaf-shaped bronze swords,

Co. Fermanagh.</span>
</div>

<p>No moulds for casting leaf-shaped
swords of either type have been found
in Ireland; and it is therefore probable
that at the time they were in use sand-casting
had replaced casting from stone
moulds. The scabbards of the leaf-shaped
swords were made of wood or leather,
protected by a ferule or chape of bronze,
which was fastened to it by rivets; the
point of the weapon does not seem to have
reached the end of the sheath. There
are several examples of bronze chapes
in the Royal Irish Academy&#8217;s collection,
and they display a considerable variety
of design. Some are long and tubular in
shape (fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a>), while others are of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
winged or boat-shaped type which is found on the Continent
(fig. <a href="#fig67">67</a>). Others again are of a small and simple type. The
rivet-holes for the attachment of the sheaths can be seen in
nearly all the Irish specimens. The casting of these objects
shows a good deal of skill, as the metal is very thin. The
winged variety are probably the latest, as they have been found
with iron swords of Hallstatt type on the Continent.</p>

<p>Two circular shields or bucklers of bronze have been found
in Ireland. There is only one in the National Collection, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
fine shield discovered at Lough Gur, County Limerick. There
is, however, a small shield of bronze ornamented with large
bosses in the British Museum which was found at Athenry, County
Galway.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
These bronze shields have never been found
in the British Islands with any objects which would give any
definite clue to their date; but they are generally referred
to the late Bronze Age. They belong to a common type, being
decorated with numerous bands of small bosses separated by
concentric circles. They appear to have been hammered out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two other shields of great interest in the National
Collection. One is the remarkable alder-wood shield found
10 feet deep in a bog in 1863 at Annadale, County Leitrim.
This shield is oval in shape, and has a central boss and
seven raised ribs. It will be noticed that the ribs show an
indentation at one side; but too much emphasis must not be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
placed on this, as the shield shrank a good deal after its
removal from the bog, and the alteration may be due to this.
This shield has a handle at the back. It is interesting to note
that &lsquo;sciath,&rsquo; one of the Irish words for &lsquo;shield,&rsquo; denotes &lsquo;alder.&rsquo;
The next is the leather shield found in 1908 at Clonbrin,
County Longford, and presented to the Royal Irish Academy&#8217;s
collection by Colonel W. H. King-Harman. This truly remarkable
shield, the only one of its kind in Europe, is made of a
solid piece of leather nearly &frac14; of an inch thick, and measures
20&frac12; inches in length by 19&frac12; inches across. It has an oblong
centre boss pressed out of the leather and covered with an
ornamental cap of fine leather laced on to it. The boss is
encircled by three ribs, the inner one being gapped, and the two
others having a curious re-entrant angle. The shield has twenty-four
small round bosses on it which resemble those on the
bronze shields. There is a leather handle which was laced on
to the back. This shield appears to be complete as it stands,
as there is no sign of any wooden supports at the back, nor is
it easy to see how such supports could have been attached to
it. According to Polybius round shields of bulls&#8217; hide were used
by the Roman equites in the early days of Roman history.</p>

<p>The round shield of the late Bronze Age was succeeded by
the oval shield which may be taken as partly transitional to
the oblong shield of Southern Europe and also of the late Celtic
type found in Britain. The date, therefore, of this Irish
leather shield is probably to be placed in the Early Iron period.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Torcs</strong></span></p>


<p>There are twenty-four golden torcs of various types in the
National Collection and one of bronze; but the Irish provenance
of the latter is doubtful.</p>

<p>The best known are the two magnificent gold torcs found in
the side of one of the raths at Tara, and these belong to a type
that has been found in England and France, of which the
best known examples are those found at Yeovil,
Somerset,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
and Grunty Fen,
Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
A torc of this type was also
found by Schliemann in the royal treasury in the second city
of Troy. This find has led to a good deal of speculative
opinions varying as to whether the model of the torc was
imported into Ireland from the south, or whether the Irish gold
could have reached the Mediterranean in pre-Mycen&aelig;an
times.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Torcs of this type were made by folding two thin ribbons of
gold along the middle at a right angle; they were then attached
with some kind of resinous flux, apex to apex, and twisted
together. In some cases, instead of two folded ribbons a flat
one and two halves of another were used, after being fastened
together, the twisting being done in the same way. In some of
the Irish examples the body of the torc is plain, or was grooved
to simulate the appearance of the twisted torc. A peculiar
feature of these torcs is the large hooks with which they
are provided. It must be noted that whereas twisted torcs
of bronze are fairly common in England and France there is
only one bronze torc in the Irish National Collection, and, as
mentioned above, the provenance of this is doubtful. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
dating of these twisted torcs is a matter of difficulty, as there
are only two instances of their having been found in association
with bronze objects, one in the case of the Grunty Fen torc
which was discovered with three bronze palstaves, and another
found at Fresn&eacute; la M&egrave;re, near Falaise, Normandy, which was
found with a bronze razor and other objects of bronze. Such
evidence as exists, therefore, would place them in the late
Bronze Age, probably somewhere about 1000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but certain
varieties of torcs, as we shall see, continued in use as late as the
first century. The area of distribution of gold torcs of the Tara
type in Ireland, England and France is very limited, none having
been found in Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Holland, or Spain and
Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
It has been suggested that the gold
of which all these torcs were composed came from the Wicklow
Mountains,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
and in view of the extreme wealth of Ireland in
gold, as evinced by the number of gold ornaments which are
still constantly found, this may be considered probable.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the other types of gold torcs are two splendid
examples, one of which appears to have been prepared for
twisting and left unfinished, while the other is in a complete
state (<a href="#plate8">Plate VIII</a>).</p>

<p>Small torcs made by twisting a plain ribbon are fairly
common, and some of these are so small that they must have
been used as bracelets.</p>

<p>In later times the torc was the distinguishing ornament of
the Celt, and there are many allusions to torcs in classical
writers. In 223 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when Flaminius Nepos gained his victory
over the Gauls on the Addua, it is related that instead of the
Gauls dedicating, as they had intended, a torc made from the
Roman spoils to their god of war, the Romans erected a Roman
trophy to Jupiter made from Gaulish torcs.</p>

<p>The name of the Torquati, a family of the Manlia Gens, was
derived from their ancestor, T. Manlius, who, having slain a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
gigantic Gaul in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 361, took the torc from the dead body,
and placed it round his neck.</p>

<p>The famous statue of the Dying Gaul preserved in the
Capitol at Rome shows a torc on the warrior&#8217;s neck. This is
one of a series of statues set up by the Greeks of Pergamos to
celebrate their struggle with, and first victory over, the Gauls
of Asia Minor, with whom they came in contact from about
240 to 160 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The twisted torc appears to have been replaced
in Ireland about the second century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> by the plain torc,
which was probably introduced from Gaul. The fine gold torc
from Clonmacnois (<a href="#plate9">Plate IX</a>), with La T&egrave;ne decoration, is a
good example of these torcs, and is almost identical with one
from the Marne district now preserved in the St. Germain
Museum. Probably the finest La T&egrave;ne torc in existence is that
found in the celebrated Broighter find, which is richly decorated
with La T&egrave;ne ornament (<a href="#plate9">Plate IX</a>, the inner torc).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties to be contended with in any
attempt to arrive at a working chronology for the Prehistoric
Period in Ireland is that, though Ireland had a rich Bronze
Age, as attested by the magnificent collection of objects preserved
in the National Collection, yet in very few cases have
any of these objects been found in association. Excavation
carried on under scientific supervision was practically unknown
in Ireland until quite recent years, and though, no
doubt, hoards of associated objects have been discovered
in the country, yet trustworthy particulars as to their finding
have hardly ever been preserved, and the objects themselves
have generally been scattered. Under these circumstances it
seemed useful to gather together in the present chapter an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
account of the finds&mdash;unfortunately very few&mdash;in which
associated objects have been discovered, and of which there
is indisputable evidence of their association:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Find of a socketed celt, a gouge, a pin, a razor (the last
in a simple leather case), a portion of a woollen garment, an
ornament of horse-hair, like a tassel, and some pieces of wood.
These objects were found in a bog in the townland of Cromaghs,
parish of Armoy, Co. Antrim, in May, 1904, when cutting
turf<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
(Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>, nos. 1-5).</p>

<p>2. A find of late Bronze-Age objects discovered in a bog in
the townland of Lahardoun, Tulla, Co. Clare, in May, 1861.
The find contained the following objects:&mdash;two small socketed
celts, a disk-headed pin, a plain bronze ring, and a bronze
fibula<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
(Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>, nos. 6-10).</p>

<p>3. Find at Mountrivers, Rylane, Coachford, Co. Cork.
This find was made in May, 1907, and contained the following
objects:&mdash;two socketed bronze celts, two gold fibul&aelig;, one
fibula of copper or bronze, and eleven amber
beads<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
(fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a>).</p>

<p>4. Find at Kilfeakle, Co. Tipperary, made in May, 1906,
The find consisted of a bronze socketed celt, a socketed sickle,
two chisels, and a
gouge<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
(fig. <a href="#fig74">74</a>).</p>

<p>5. Find of moulds for casting primitive spear-heads. This
find was made near Omagh, Co. Tyrone, about 1882, and
consisted of seven blocks of sandstone for casting tanged and socketed
spear-heads.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>

pins, with cup-shaped heads, a bronze dagger and two bronze
knives (one of the latter being socketed), a socketed celt, nine
bronze rings, a bronze ring with side perforations and a double
ring, a bronze fibula with three beads; also two late brooches,
and two late pins, which are said to have proved part of this

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Bronze Trumpets</strong></span></p>


<p>Numerous trumpets of cast bronze have been found in
Ireland, both in the south and the north. They are rare in
Britain. Two or more trumpets have often been found together;
eight were found at Dungannon, County Tyrone, in 1713, and
thirteen or fourteen near Cork in 1750. The Irish trumpets
may be divided into three types&mdash;(1) in the shape of a horn,
open at both ends, having the mouth-piece and trumpet cast in
one piece; (2) of similar shape, but closed at the narrow end,
with an aperture for the mouth at the side near the closed
end; (3) also horn-shaped, but with a long straight tube
attached to the narrow end of the carved portion, the upper
end of the tube having four rivet-holes, to which another tube
or mouth-piece may have been fixed. There are references in
classical authorities to the trumpets used by the Celts.
Polybius, describing the defeat of the Celts by the Romans
at the battle of Telemon, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 225, speaks of the innumerable
horns and trumpets of the Celts (Gaesat&aelig;, Insubres, Taurisci,
and Boii).</p>

<p>Dr. F. Behn, of the Mainz Museum, has recently written an
account of the music in the Roman army, in which he has
brought together much information about the early bronze
trumpets; and he includes a short description of the Irish
type.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
The Irish trumpets, which are furnished with the straight
tubular piece, much resemble the Roman lituus; and, as a
whole, the Irish type is very closely allied to the lituus and
carnyx, the difference between the lituus and carnyx being
that the expanded end of the carnyx takes the form of
some fantastic animal&#8217;s head. Trumpets have been found
in the Dowris hoard, with socketed spear-heads, and other
objects of the late Bronze Age, and they must be dated to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
that period; on this account the Etruscan lituus can
hardly have been derived from Irish trumpets; so that it is
probable that the Irish trumpets, like those of Gaul, were
derived from the south.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Socketed bronze sickles have been found fairly frequently
in different parts of Ireland. Those in the National Collection
have generally been referred to the late Bronze Age. These
sickles are all very small, and it has been thought that
the Irish, like the Gauls, cut only the ear of the corn, and
burnt the stalk. A recent find of moulds in County Antrim
contained a mould for casting a sickle without a socket like
the Continental examples, and shows that this type was also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
known in Ireland in the later Bronze Age (fig. <a href="#fig75">75</a>). The bronze
sickles have an important bearing on the question of agriculture
in Ireland. An opinion has recently been expressed that corn was
not introduced into England until the Roman invasion, and was
introduced into Ireland even later than
this.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
However, there are instances of ears of corn being found within the walls of
food-vessels of early Bronze Age date in Scotland; and it is
probable that corn was also grown in Ireland during the Bronze
Age. There is evidence that the ox was domesticated during
this period. The excellence of the metal-casting and the high
degree of skill shown in casting implements and weapons during
the Bronze Age lead us to believe that the civilization, and with
the civilization the art of agriculture and material comfort,
had reached a fairly high level.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 79.&mdash;Bronze button.</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the late period of the Irish Bronze Age, bronze pins with
disk-shaped heads having a conical projection in the centre are
fairly common. The disk-heads in many instances are ornamented
with concentric circles and other simple kinds of
decoration. They are bent at right angles to the pin, though
in some cases the pin comes straight from the head. The pins
are very long, some measuring as much as 12 inches. In the
very interesting find at Armoy, County Antrim (p. <a href="#Page_81">81</a>), it will
be remembered that one of these pins was found together with
a woollen garment, and there is no doubt they were used to
fasten the dress. The fact of a razor being one of the objects
of this find indicates that the pins were used by men, though
no doubt they may also have been worn by women. The use of
such long pins seems to point to the wearing of some kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
cloak-like garment probably fastened in the front; and the
ornamental heads of the pins indicate that they were worn in a
conspicuous place.</p>

<p>As well as the pins a few bronze buttons have been found
consisting of disks with the same conical projection, but having
the pin replaced by a small bar at the back. One remarkable
example in the National Collection measures 4&frac34; inches in
diameter (fig. <a href="#fig78">78</a>). This object was probably either attached to
a leathern belt or possibly may have been a portion of a horse&#8217;s
furniture. The smaller buttons have been found on the
Continent, and are fairly numerous in the Continental lake-dwellings
or finds of the late Bronze Age.</p>

<p>One is tempted to see in the Irish examples a derivation of
the button from the pin.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 82.&mdash;Food-vessel with cover, Danesfort, Co. Kilkenny.</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Ireland the pottery of the Bronze Age is principally
represented by the type of vessel known as a food-vessel. We
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
may commence with these, as there has only been one undoubted
find of beakers made: this consisted of the remains of three
vessels found together at Moytura, County Sligo, and preserved
in the National Collection. A beaker is stated to have been found
at Mount Stewart, County Cavan; but the vessel is not extant,
and the evidence as to its discovery is not perfectly satisfactory.
The Irish food-vessel is derived directly from the round-bottomed
vessel of Neolithic times. Some of these round-bottomed bowls
have been found with Neolithic remains at Portstewart, County
Down, and there is one in the National Collection described as
found in a cavern associated with stone implements beside the
moat of Dunagore, near the town of Antrim. The development
from the Neolithic bowl can be clearly traced in the Irish
series. The earliest are flat, almost saucer-shaped bowls, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
are generally covered all over with ornament, and often have a
cruciform pattern on the base which has been thought to
indicate that the vessels were turned mouth downwards when
not in use.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These bowls have a very pleasing effect; and, as Dr.
Abercromby says: &ldquo;The small native women, sometimes under
five feet high, who made these little vessels, had certainly a fine
sense of form and a delicate perception of the beauty of curved
forms. The care and precision with which the ornament was
effected, and the richness of the effect produced by simple means, may excite our
admiration.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the next stage a slight indentation about the centre of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the vessel can be noticed, the ornament being arranged on
either side above and below this; next two small ridges develop
out of this, which are at first close together, but are afterwards
placed further apart, and in the later stages the vessel becomes
considerably higher, the base assuming the form of a cone,
and the upper portion having an everted lip. Some of these
latter vessels have a number of small ribs encircling them.
<a href="#plate11">Plate XI</a> shows a series of food-vessels placed in the order of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
their evolution. The decoration can be well seen. It consists
for the most part of chevron, herring-bone, and other linear
ornament, but wavy lines can be seen in some examples. In
some rare cases the food-vessels were provided with lids
(fig. <a href="#fig82">82</a>). All of these vessels were made by hand; and
though the baking of the pottery varies, it was evidently
done over a fire.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 85.&mdash;Cinerary urn, Cookstown,<br /> Co. Tyrone.</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The food-vessels, which are found both with unburnt and
burnt interments, continued in use during the greater part of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the Bronze Age, and the name food-vessel is hardly appropriate
in Ireland, as in many cases these vessels have been found
containing cremated bones, having apparently served the
purpose of cinerary urns.</p>

<p>The so-called cinerary urns are large vessels which have
been usually discovered containing human bones; they have
often been found inverted over cremated remains. They can
be conveniently divided into several types, of which the type
with the overhanging rim may be mentioned first. In this
type the vessel consists of two portions, a lower flower-pot-like
cone, on which is placed a larger truncated cone, which forms
the overhanging rim. This type is widely distributed in
England, and in Ireland has been found in the Counties of
Antrim, Down, and Tyrone. The cordoned or hooped type is
developed from the preceding type by replacing the overhanging
rim by a moulding, both types being contemporary. In
the encrusted type the urn, which is of the flower-pot shape,
is decorated with strips of clay in the form of chevrons and
bosses, the ornamentation assuming a rope-like form. Urns of
this type have been found at Greenhills, Tallaght, County
Dublin; Gortnain, Broomhedge, County Antrim; Tullyweggin,
Cookstown, County Tyrone; Closkett, Drumgooland, and
Glanville, Newry, County Down.</p>

<p>Very small vessels, of usually about 2 to 2&frac12; inches in height,
are often found in interments associated with the large cinerary
urns, and occasionally, when the latter are inverted, are found
inside them. The exact use of these small vessels, which
are called &ldquo;incense-cups&rdquo; or &ldquo;pygmy-cups,&rdquo; is a matter of
speculation; several theories have been advanced to explain the
purpose of placing them in graves, but none of them are altogether
satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Like the other vessels, they can be divided into different
types, of which some are peculiar to England, and even there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
confined to certain counties. In Ireland several of these small
cups have perforated walls, while some have handles. One
remarkable specimen found at Knocknacoura, Co. Carlow, is
covered all over with ornament.</p>

<p>In the fine cist discovered at Greenhills, County Dublin,
and now set up in the National Museum, a very remarkable
little cup was found inside the large inverted cinerary urn
(fig. <a href="#fig84">84</a>). The form of this small cup appears to be originally
derived from a metal prototype, and exactly resembles
pottery-vessels of Iron-Age date found in the cemetery at
Marne.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>Bronze-age Ornamentation in Ireland</strong></span></p>


<p>The ornament of the Bronze Age in Ireland consists of
chevrons, hatched triangles, lozenges, etc., combined with some
wavy patterns, and later in some instances with the spirals introduced from
Scandinavia,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
where this motive had penetrated
early from the &AElig;gean along the amber route. This early
type of ornament can be seen on some of the bronze celts,
and also on the pottery, notably the food-vessels, which
are often most tastefully decorated. The ornamentation,
however, can be most fully studied on the inscribed stones in
the great monuments of the New Grange group. These monuments,
perhaps the most remarkable in Western Europe, have
justly aroused the interest of generations of arch&aelig;ologists, and
many interpretations have been placed upon their decoration.
Having dealt so fully with this subject in a recent book, &ldquo;New
Grange and other Incised Tumuli in Ireland,&rdquo; 1912, it is not
proposed to go into the question again, but there are one or
two points that may be noticed.</p>

<p>The most remarkable feature about the ornamentation at
New Grange is the occurrence of the spiral motive; and it is
the presence of this distinctive motive which has led to so
much speculation.</p>

<p>It may be stated at once that the general view at present
held by those who have studied the question is that the spiral
was introduced, and that in the case of Ireland it was
derived from Scandinavia.</p>

<p>The similarity between New Grange and the tholos tombs
of the mainland of Greece is so striking that it is at least
likely that the former may have been derived from the latter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
In examining the monument of New Grange, the author
had been led by long study, and the comparison with motives
common in the &AElig;gean at about the same period, to explain
the ornamentation, notably in the cases of the large stones
illustrated in the book, p. 75, as derived from combinations of
ornaments commonly found on &AElig;gean pottery, these motives
being themselves connected with the symbolism of sun-worship.
In the case of other markings, it was considered these were
possibly derived from the decoration of certain objects of
Scandinavian origin. In an article in <em>L&#8217;Anthropologie</em>, vol. xxiii,
p. 29, dealing with the subject, M. J. D&eacute;chelette has put
forward other views with regard to the markings at New
Grange. M. D&eacute;chelette sees in the markings at New Grange a
degenerated copy of the female idols of neolithic times, carvings
of which in a more or less rudimentary form have been found in
the Iberian peninsula, Italy, France, England, and Scandinavia.
It may be mentioned that from the occurrence of carvings
of this idol on sepulchral monuments it is to be connected
with funeral rites. M. D&eacute;chelette supports his contentions with
a wealth of illustrations drawn from the tattooed idols of
Greece, Portugal, and Aveyron, the engraved chalk cylinder
from Madrid, the incised lines from Almizaraque, the sculptures
from the artificial grottos of Marne, the vase fragments of
Charantaise, the chalk drum from Folkton Wold (Yorkshire),
and the engravings from the dolmens of Locmariaquer.</p>

<p>On p. 43 M. D&eacute;chelette gives a scheme of the evolution of
the pattern of the idol, starting from fairly well-defined eyes,
eyebrows, and nose, with chevron marks imitating tattooing.
The face becomes stylized by the substitution of a mere arched
line for the eyebrows, and concentric circles for the eyes, the
tattooing marks becoming a conventional pattern of regular
chevrons. In the Irish examples the spiral replaces the
concentric circles for the eyes, and the pattern below is further
enriched by lozenges, and finally we arrive at a form in which
the spiral has an eyebrow above and a single lozenge below,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and this form M. D&eacute;chelette compares to the engravings on the
slabs at New Grange. The shield-like figure on the roofing
stone of the right recess at New Grange is compared by
M. D&eacute;chelette to the engravings on the dolmen of Pierres-Plates
at Locmariaquer, which also appear to be a stylized form
of the idol.</p>

<p>M. D&eacute;chelette compares the very remarkable boundary-stone
at Dowth, with the engraving of suns on it, to the
vases from Millares, province d&#8217;Alm&eacute;rie, which are ornamented
with raised circles, these in their turn being derived from a
degenerate form of the idol.</p>

<p>M. D&eacute;chelette applies the same explanation to the scribings
at Gavir&#8217;inis, the spiral ornamentation of which is to be
regarded as derived from Ireland.</p>

<p>This very brilliant and original interpretation of the
scribings at New Grange seems to fit the case exceedingly
well, and M. D&eacute;chelette&#8217;s theory may be regarded as a very
probable one for the origin of the markings, but it must
be remembered that there is some difficulty caused by the
fact that the similarity in plan between New Grange and the
tholos tombs, as has been pointed out, is too great to be
neglected. Now if New Grange is derived from this source, it
cannot well be placed earlier than 1000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The idol, on the
other hand, is neolithic in date, and must have survived a
considerable time to have influenced the Irish carvings. It
must also be borne in mind that no other forms of this idol
have been met with in Ireland.</p>
